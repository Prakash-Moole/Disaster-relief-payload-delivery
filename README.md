# Automated Disaster Relief Payload Delivery System (REVIVE Hackathon)

This project was developed as part of **REVIVE**, a campus hackathon at **VIT Chennai**, aimed at designing an automated system for delivering critical supplies (medical kits, food, communication devices) to remote or hazardous disaster‑hit locations.

## Problem Statement
Delivering supplies to inaccessible or dangerous regions during disasters poses logistical and safety challenges. Our task was to design a system capable of:
- Robust payload handling in adverse weather and terrain.
- Autonomous navigation with obstacle avoidance.
- Accurate payload delivery, even in GPS‑denied environments.

## My Role
- **Developed a simulation algorithm** using nested matrices to represent the disaster‑affected area.  
- **Designed logic to identify optimal delivery zones** for payload drops within constrained environments.  
- **Collaborated with the team** in brainstorming overall system design and secure payload mechanisms.

## Tech Stack
- **Python** – For scenario simulation and algorithm development  
- **Matrix-based modeling** – To represent zones and identify optimal drop areas  
- **Team collaboration** – Contributed to overall system concept design  

## Outcome
- Designed a **proof‑of‑concept simulation** for safe and efficient payload delivery area selection.
- Gained experience in **algorithm design for navigation and constrained area analysis**.
