# Automated Disaster Relief Payload Delivery System (REVIVE Hackathon)

This project was developed as part of **REVIVE**, a campus hackathon at **VIT Chennai**, where our team of three designed an **automated system for delivering critical supplies** (medical kits, food, communication devices) to remote or hazardous disaster‑hit locations.

## Problem Statement
Delivering supplies to inaccessible or dangerous regions during disasters poses logistical and safety challenges. Our task was to design a system capable of:
- **Robust payload handling** in adverse weather and terrain.
- **Autonomous navigation** with obstacle avoidance.
- **Accurate payload delivery**, even in GPS‑denied environments.

## Teamwork & My Role
We worked as a **team of three**, collaborating closely on system design and implementation:
- **My Role:**  
  - Developed a **simulation algorithm** using nested matrices to find and represent disaster‑affected areas.  
  - Designed logic to **identify optimal delivery zones** for payload drops within constrained environments.  
  - Assisted in brainstorming the **overall payload mechanism and navigation strategy**.  

## Tech Stack
- **C** – For scenario simulation and algorithm development  
- **Matrix-based modeling** – To represent zones and identify optimal drop areas  
- **Collaborative design** – Team discussions for system and mechanism design  

## Outcome
- Built a **proof‑of‑concept simulation** for safe and efficient payload delivery area selection.
- Strengthened skills in **algorithm design**, **system planning**, and **team collaboration** under time constraints.
